    <h1> This is my first project! </h1>
	    <img src="https://github.com/1925215/CSP---Simeon/blob/main/Court.PNG?raw=true">
	    <p>My project was to make a basketball court with a playable ball that you could choose the color of and move with the arrow keys!</p>
	    <p>In the terminal, a scoreboard would keep track of how many points each team scored, based off a collision detection system between the ball and the hoops</p>
    <h1> This is my Space Invaders Game! </h1>
	    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1925215/CSP---Simeon/refs/heads/main/spaceinvaders.PNG">
	    <p>I made a playable Space Invaders game where you could control a ship and shoot aliens!</p>
	    <p>There is a timer and a scoreboard at the top to keep track of your score, and when you kill aliens they disappear.</p>
    <h1> Minions Blast-Off Birthday Bash! </h1>
	    <img src="https://github.com/1925215/CSP---Simeon/blob/main/imageeeeee.png?raw=true">
	    <p>For this project, we made a cool animation of Gru's ship from Minions flying across the screen with minions talking in the background</p>
	    <p>When you click on the ship, it explodes and the minions fall out on parachutes. There is one minion holding a card so when you click on it, a birthday card pops up!</p>
    <h1>Phishy Fish Tank</h1>

	<p>In this project, I debugged the code that was given to us and found out the different indexing and code areas using VS Code's embedded degbugging tool!</p>

      <br>
      <p>We created this local multiplayer game where two people can play with characters that have running animations across different maps with power ups and more!</p>
    <h1>Using Python we created a customized GUI!</h1>
        <img src="https://github.com/1925215/CSP---Simeon/blob/main/GUI.png?raw=true" height="300">
      <p>We made three buttons, customizing them with minion images, to do the commands ping, tracert, and nslookup for any URL you want!</p>
